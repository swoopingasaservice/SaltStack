##########################################
# This configuration file is used to manage the behavior of the Salt Minion.
# With the exception of the location of the Salt Master Server, values that are
# commented out but have an empty line after the comment are defaults that need
# not be set in the config. If there is no blank line after the comment, the
# value is presented as an example and is not the default.

# Per default the minion will automatically include all config files
# from minion.d/*.conf (minion.d is a directory in the same directory
# as the main minion config file).
#default_include: minion.d/*.conf

# Set the location of the salt master server. If the master server cannot be
# resolved, then the minion will fail to start.
master: 192.168.1.18
interface: 192.168.1.18

# Set http proxy information for the minion when doing requests
#proxy_host:
#proxy_port:
#proxy_username:
#proxy_password:

# List of hosts to bypass HTTP proxy. This key does nothing unless proxy_host etc is
# configured, it does not support any kind of wildcards.
#no_proxy: []

# If multiple masters are specified in the 'master' setting, the default behavior
# is to always try to connect to them in the order they are listed. If random_master
# is set to True, the order will be randomized upon Minion startup instead. This can
# be helpful in distributing the load of many minions executing salt-call requests,
# for example, from a cron job. If only one master is listed, this setting is ignored
# and a warning will be logged.
#random_master: False

# NOTE: Deprecated in Salt 2019.2.0. Use 'random_master' instead.
#master_shuffle: False

# Minions can connect to multiple masters simultaneously (all masters
# are "hot"), or can be configured to failover if a master becomes
# unavailable.  Multiple hot masters are configured by setting this
# value to "str".  Failover masters can be requested by setting
# to "failover".  MAKE SURE TO SET master_alive_interval if you are
# using failover.
# Setting master_type to 'disable' lets you have a running minion (with engines and
# beacons) without a master connection
# master_type: str

# Poll interval in seconds for checking if the master is still there.  Only
# respected if master_type above is "failover". To disable the interval entirely,
# set the value to -1. (This may be necessary on machines which have high numbers
# of TCP connections, such as load balancers.)
# master_alive_interval: 30

# If the minion is in multi-master mode and the master_type configuration option
# is set to "failover", this setting can be set to "True" to force the minion
# to fail back to the first master in the list if the first master is back online.
#master_failback: False

# If the minion is in multi-master mode, the "master_type" configuration is set to
# "failover", and the "master_failback" option is enabled, the master failback
# interval can be set to ping the top master with this interval, in seconds.
#master_failback_interval: 0

# Set whether the minion should connect to the master via IPv6:
#ipv6: False

# Set the number of seconds to wait before attempting to resolve
# the master hostname if name resolution fails. Defaults to 30 seconds.
# Set to zero if the minion should shutdown and not retry.
# retry_dns: 30

# Set the number of times to attempt to resolve
# the master hostname if name resolution fails. Defaults to None,
# which will attempt the resolution indefinitely.
# retry_dns_count: 3

# Set the port used by the master reply and authentication server.
master_port: 4506

# The user to run salt.
#user: root

# The user to run salt remote execution commands as via sudo. If this option is
# enabled then sudo will be used to change the active user executing the remote
# command. If enabled the user will need to be allowed access via the sudoers
# file for the user that the salt minion is configured to run as. The most
# common option would be to use the root user. If this option is set the user
# option should also be set to a non-root user. If migrating from a root minion
# to a non root minion the minion cache should be cleared and the minion pki
# directory will need to be changed to the ownership of the new user.
#sudo_user: root

# Specify the location of the daemon process ID file.
#pidfile: /var/run/salt-minion.pid

# The root directory prepended to these options: pki_dir, cachedir, log_file,
# sock_dir, pidfile.
#root_dir: /

# The path to the minion's configuration file.
#conf_file: /etc/salt/minion

# The directory to store the pki information in
#pki_dir: /etc/salt/pki/minion

# Explicitly declare the id for this minion to use, if left commented the id
# will be the hostname as returned by the python call: socket.getfqdn()
# Since salt uses detached ids it is possible to run multiple minions on the
# same machine but with different ids, this can be useful for salt compute
# clusters.
#id:

# Cache the minion id to a file when the minion's id is not statically defined
# in the minion config. Defaults to "True". This setting prevents potential
# problems when automatic minion id resolution changes, which can cause the
# minion to lose connection with the master. To turn off minion id caching,
# set this config to ``False``.
#minion_id_caching: True

# Convert minion id to lowercase when it is being generated. Helpful when some
# hosts get the minion id in uppercase. Cached ids will remain the same and
# not converted. For example, Windows minions often have uppercase minion
# names when they are set up but not always. To turn on, set this config to
# ``True``.
#minion_id_lowercase: False

# Append a domain to a hostname in the event that it does not exist.  This is
# useful for systems where socket.getfqdn() does not actually result in a
# FQDN (for instance, Solaris).
#append_domain:

# Custom static grains for this minion can be specified here and used in SLS
# files just like all other grains. This example sets 4 custom grains, with
# the 'roles' grain having two values that can be matched against.
#grains:
#  roles:
#    - webserver
#    - memcache
#  deployment: datacenter4
#  cabinet: 13
#  cab_u: 14-15
#
# Where cache data goes.
# This data may contain sensitive data and should be protected accordingly.
#cachedir: /var/cache/salt/minion

# Append minion_id to these directories.  Helps with
# multiple proxies and minions running on the same machine.
# Allowed elements in the list: pki_dir, cachedir, extension_modules
# Normally not needed unless running several proxies and/or minions on the same machine
# Defaults to ['cachedir'] for proxies, [] (empty list) for regular minions
#append_minionid_config_dirs:

# Verify and set permissions on configuration directories at startup.
#verify_env: True

# The minion can locally cache the return data from jobs sent to it, this
# can be a good way to keep track of jobs the minion has executed
# (on the minion side). By default this feature is disabled, to enable, set
# cache_jobs to True.
#cache_jobs: False

# Set the directory used to hold unix sockets.
#sock_dir: /var/run/salt/minion

# In order to calculate the fqdns grain, all the IP addresses from the minion
# are processed with underlying calls to `socket.gethostbyaddr` which can take
# 5 seconds to be released (after reaching `socket.timeout`) when there is no
# fqdn for that IP. These calls to `socket.gethostbyaddr` are processed
# asynchronously, however, it still adds 5 seconds every time grains are
# generated if an IP does not resolve. In Windows grains are regenerated each
# time a new process is spawned. Therefore, the default for Windows is `False`.
# On macOS, FQDN resolution can be very slow, therefore the default for macOS is
# `False` as well. All other OSes default to `True`
# enable_fqdns_grains: True

# The minion can take a while to start up when lspci and/or dmidecode is used
# to populate the grains for the minion. Set this to False if you do not need
# GPU hardware grains for your minion.
# enable_gpu_grains: True

# Set the default outputter used by the salt-call command. The default is
# "nested".
#output: nested

# To set a list of additional directories to search for salt outputters, set the
# outputter_dirs option.
#outputter_dirs: []

# By default output is colored. To disable colored output, set the color value
# to False.
#color: True

# Do not strip off the colored output from nested results and state outputs
# (true by default).
# strip_colors: False

# Backup files that are replaced by file.managed and file.recurse under
# 'cachedir'/file_backup relative to their original location and appended
# with a timestamp. The only valid setting is "minion". Disabled by default.
#
# Alternatively this can be specified for each file in state files:
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
#   file.managed:
#     - source: salt://ssh/sshd_config
#     - backup: minion
#
#backup_mode: minion

# When waiting for a master to accept the minion's public key, salt will
# continuously attempt to reconnect until successful. This is the time, in
# seconds, between those reconnection attempts.
#acceptance_wait_time: 10

# If this is nonzero, the time between reconnection attempts will increase by
# acceptance_wait_time seconds per iteration, up to this maximum. If this is
# set to zero, the time between reconnection attempts will stay constant.
#acceptance_wait_time_max: 0

# If the master rejects the minion's public key, retry instead of exiting.
# Rejected keys will be handled the same as waiting on acceptance.
#rejected_retry: False

# When the master key changes, the minion will try to re-auth itself to receive
# the new master key. In larger environments this can cause a SYN flood on the
# master because all minions try to re-auth immediately. To prevent this and
# have a minion wait for a random amount of time, use this optional parameter.
# The wait-time will be a random number of seconds between 0 and the defined value.
#random_reauth_delay: 60


# To avoid overloading a master when many minions startup at once, a randomized
# delay may be set to tell the minions to wait before connecting to the master.
# This value is the number of seconds to choose from for a random number. For
# example, setting this value to 60 will choose a random number of seconds to delay
# on startup between zero seconds and sixty seconds. Setting to '0' will disable
# this feature.
#random_startup_delay: 0

# When waiting for a master to accept the minion's public key, salt will
# continuously attempt to reconnect until successful. This is the timeout value,
# in seconds, for each individual attempt. After this timeout expires, the minion
# will wait for acceptance_wait_time seconds before trying again. Unless your master
# is under unusually heavy load, this should be left at the default.
#auth_timeout: 60

# Number of consecutive SaltReqTimeoutError that are acceptable when trying to
# authenticate.
#auth_tries: 7

# The number of attempts to connect to a master before giving up.
# Set this to -1 for unlimited attempts. This allows for a master to have
# downtime and the minion to reconnect to it later when it comes back up.
# In 'failover' mode, it is the number of attempts for each set of masters.
# In this mode, it will cycle through the list of masters for each attempt.
#
# This is different than auth_tries because auth_tries attempts to
# retry auth attempts with a single master. auth_tries is under the
# assumption that you can connect to the master but not gain
# authorization from it. master_tries will still cycle through all
# the masters in a given try, so it is appropriate if you expect
# occasional downtime from the master(s).
#master_tries: 1

# If authentication fails due to SaltReqTimeoutError during a ping_interval,
# cause sub minion process to restart.
#auth_safemode: False

# Ping Master to ensure connection is alive (minutes).
#ping_interval: 0

# To auto recover minions if master changes IP address (DDNS)
#    auth_tries: 10
#    auth_safemode: True
#    ping_interval: 2
#
# Minions won't know master is missing until a ping fails. After the ping fail,
# the minion will attempt authentication and likely fails out and cause a restart.
# When the minion restarts it will resolve the masters IP and attempt to reconnect.
