# This configuration file is used to manage the behavior of the Salt Master.
# Values that are commented out but have an empty line after the comment are
# defaults that do not need to be set in the config. If there is no blank line
# after the comment then the value is presented as an example and is not the
# default.

# Per default, the master will automatically include all config files
# from master.d/*.conf (master.d is a directory in the same directory
# as the main master config file).
#default_include: master.d/*.conf

# The address of the interface to bind to:
interface: 192.168.1.18

# Whether the master should listen for IPv6 connections. If this is set to True,
# the interface option must be adjusted, too. (For example: "interface: '::'")
#ipv6: False

# The tcp port used by the publisher:
publish_port: 4505

# The user under which the salt master will run. Salt will update all
# permissions to allow the specified user to run the master. The exception is
# the job cache, which must be deleted if this user is changed. If the
# modified files cause conflicts, set verify_env to False.
user: salt

# Tell the master to also use salt-ssh when running commands against minions.
#enable_ssh_minions: False

# The port used by the communication interface. The ret (return) port is the
